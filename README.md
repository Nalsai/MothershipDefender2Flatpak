# MothershipDefender2Flatpak

ðŸ“¦ Flatpak Package of Mothership Defender 2 for Linux

## Installing

I'm hosting this Mothership Defender 2 Flatpak on my own Flatpak Repo. You can install it from there like this:

```bash
flatpak install https://flatpak.nils.moe/de.Nalsai.MothershipDefender2.flatpakref
```

You can also install it from the bundle in Releases on GitHub, but you won't get updates that way.
